                Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                emphasizes code readability with its use of significant indentation. Its language constructs as well as
                its object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale
                projects.
            </p>

                Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
                structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described
                as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

                    To get started with Python, open your perfered code editor and insert and run the following code.
                </p>
                <h2>Hello world:<h2>
                        <code>print('Hello, world!')</code>
                        <h2>Factorial of a positive integer:</h2>
                        <code>n = int(input('Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: '))
      
      if n &lt; 0:
               <div class='ind'>raise ValueError('You must enter a non-negative integer')</div>
      factorial = 1
      for i in range(2, n + 1):
              <div class='ind'>factorial *= i</div>
               print(factorial)</code>

                    Python has no command for declaring a variable. A variable is created the moment you first assign a
                    value to it. Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type
                    after they have been first set.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
                    <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
                    <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
                    </li>
                    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
                </ul>
                <code> x = 4       #x is of type int
      x = "Sally" #x is now of type str
      print(x)

        <section id='Variable_scope' class='main-section'>
            <header>Variable scope</header>
            <article>
                <p>
                    A scope defines the visibility of a name within a block. If a local variable is defined in a block,
                    its scope includes that block. If the definition occurs in a function block, the scope extends to
                    any blocks contained within the defining one, unless a contained block introduces a different
                    binding for the name. When a name is used in a code block, it is resolved using the nearest
                    enclosing scope. The set of all such scopes visible to a code block is called the block’s
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The global statement has the same scope as a name binding operation in the same block. If the
                    nearest enclosing scope for a free variable contains a global statement, the free variable is
                    treated as a global.
                </p>
                <code>x = "awesome"
      def myfunc():
              <div class='ind'>print("Python is " + x)</div>
      myfunc() #prints "Python is awesome"
            </code>
                <p>
                    The nonlocal statement causes corresponding names to refer to previously bound variables in the
                    nearest enclosing function scope. SyntaxError is raised at compile time if the given name does not
                    exist in any enclosing function scope.
                </p>
                <code>x = "awesome"
      def myfunc():
              <div class='ind'>x = "fantastic"</div><div class='ind'>print("Python is " + x)</div>
      myfunc() #prints "Python is fantastic"
            </code>

                    Python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not
                    checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object
                    is not of a suitable type. Despite being dynamically-typed, Python is strongly-typed, forbidding
                    operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently
                    attempting to make sense of them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The most common types used in Python are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>bool: True and False.</li>
                    <li>dict: Associative array (or dictionary) of key and value pairs; can contain mixed types (keys
                        and values), keys must be a hashable type</li>
                    <li>float: Double-precision floating-point number. The precision is machine-dependent but in
                        practice is generally implemented as a 64-bit IEEE 754 number with 53 bits of precision.</li>
                    <li>int: Integer of unlimited magnitude.</li>
                    <li>list: Also known as an Array in other languages, can contain mixed types.</li>
                    <li>str: A character string</li>
                    <li>tuple: A collection which is ordered and unchangable</li>
                </ul>

                In Python a function is defined using the 'def' keyword. To call a function, use the function name
                followed my parenthesis holding any argumets, if any, to pass through the function.
            </p>
            <code>def my_function():
            <div class='ind'>print('Hello from a function')</div></code>
            <p>
                By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your
                function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
            </p>
            <code>def my_function(fname, lname):
            <div class='ind'>print(fname + " " + lname)</div>
            my_function("Emil", "Refsnes")</code>
